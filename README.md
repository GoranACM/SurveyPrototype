# Survey
## Final application for a simple data-driven Survey

### Scenario

A market research company that allows people from the general public to register their personal details, buying habits etc. and then sends these respondents to market research jobs, based on the needs of its clients. Currently, the company asks respondents to email their details and maintains these manual emails. To find all respondents who match the clients needs, staff at the company look through the emails to find respondents who match the criteria â€“ for example:
- Males between the ages of 24 to 29 who are interested in Horse Racing and Asia travel. Or;
- Females who use Westpac as one of their banks.

The company wants to move to a web-based system where respondents can register their details online, and staff can then search through these registrations to find respondents who match the requested criteria.
